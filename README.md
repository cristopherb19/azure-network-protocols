<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
Understanding the movement of data within a network is important because it helps IT professionals troubleshoot problems, spot security threats, and more. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll use Wireshark to examine network traffic going to and from Azure Virtual Machines, and we will also experiment with Network Security Groups. 
<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDP, DNS, DHCP, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>Key Steps</h2>

- Create a resource group
- Create a Windows 10 virtual machine
- Create a Linux(Ubuntu) virtual machine
- Make sure both virtual machines are in the same virtual network/subnet
- Connect to Windows 10 virtual machine
- Install and open Wireshark on Windows 10 virtual machine
- Observe network traffic
- Clean up Azure environment

- Finish filling out necessary fields
- Review + create your virtual machine
  
</p>
<br />

<h3>Make sure both virtual machines are in the same virtual network/subnet</h3>

<p>

  - Within Azure, navigate to "Virtual Machines"
  - Click on your Windows virtual machine and check the name of the "Virtual network/subnet"
  - Click on your Linux virtual machine and make sure the "Virtual network/subnet" is the same as in your Window virtual machine(in my case "Lab2-vnet/default")

</p>
<br />

<h3>Connect to Windows 10 Virtual Machine</h3>

<p>

- Open up Microsoft Remote Desktop
- To connect to the Windows 10 virtual machine, we need to find the Public IP Address to fill in the "Computer" field of Microsoft Remote Desktop
- To retrieve the public IP Address of the Windows 10 virtual machine, go to Azure, navigate to your Windows virtual machine and look for its "Public IP Address"
- Copy the public IP address and paste it into the "Computer" field in your Remote Desktop Application and connect

</p>
<br />

<h3>Install and open Wireshark on Windows 10 virtual machine</h3>

<p>

  - Within your Windows 10 virtual machine, open up Microsoft Edge, and download and install Wireshark
  - Open Wireshark

</p>
<br />

<h3>Observe network traffic</h3>

<p>

  - Open Microsoft Windows PowerShell as we prepare to observe network traffic
  - Within Wireshark, start packet capture by clicking the blue fin icon at the top left(under the "File" button)

</p>

<h3>ICMP Traffic</h3>

<p>

  - Within Wireshark, type in "ICMP" in the search bar and hit [Enter] to apply a filter that will only display ICMP traffic
  - Within Azure, retrieve the private IP address for the Linux(Ubuntu) virtual machine you created the same way you retrieved the Windows 10 public IP address
  - After retrieving the private IP address, we are going to attempt to ping from within the Windows 10 virtual machine
  - Within PowerShell type "ping" followed by the Linux private IP address (example. "ping 10.0.0.5")
  - Observe ping requests and replies within Wireshark

  <img src="https://imgur.com/d43sQjG.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Wireshark ICMP Traffic"/>
  - Attempt to ping a public website within PowerShell and observe traffic (example. "ping www.google.com")
  <img src="https://imgur.com/uYATxSx.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Wireshark Ping Website"/>

  - Initiate a nonstop ping from your Windows virtual machine to your Linux(Ubuntu) virtual machine by typing "-t" at the end of the ping (example. "ping 10.0.0.5 -t") and observe traffic
  <img src="https://imgur.com/VfOtQpe.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Wireshark perpetual ping"/>

  - Open the Network Security Group(NSG) your Linux(Ubuntu) virtual machine is using within Azure and disable incoming ICMP traffic by creating a port rule that denies ICMP traffic
  <img src="https://imgur.com/3w3ww6r.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Port rule"/>

  - Observe traffic, and if done correctly, the ping requests should continue to timeout
  <img src="https://imgur.com/NT4NxDl.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Ping timeout"/>

  - Re-enable ICMP traffic by either changing the port rule or deleting it from the NSG
  - Observe traffic, and if done correctly, the ping activity should start working again
  - Stop ping activity by hitting "Ctrl + C" within PowerShell
</p>

<h3>SSH Traffic</h3>

<p>

  - Within Wireshark, type in "SSH" in the search bar and hit [Enter] to apply a filter that will only display SSH traffic
  - "SSH into" your Linux(Ubuntu) virtual machine through its private IP address by typing "ssh (username)@(private IP address)" within PowerShell (Example. "ssh labuser@10.0.0.5")
  - Within PowerShell, type commands (hostname, id, etc) into the Linux(ubuntu) SSH connection and observe traffic
  <img src="https://imgur.com/ewSvGsM.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="SSH traffic"/>

  - Within PowerShell, exit the SSH connection by typing "exit" and pressing [Enter]
</p>

<h3>DHCP Traffic</h3>

<p>

- Within Wireshark, type in "DHCP" in the search bar and hit [Enter] to apply a filter that will only display DHCP traffic
- Within your Windows 10 virtual machine, attempt to issue your virtual machine a new IP address with "ipconfig /renew"
- Observe traffic
<img src="https://imgur.com/f5ZoYKR.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="DHCP"/>
</p>

<h3>DNS Traffic</h3>

<p>

- Within Wireshark, type in "DNS" in the search bar and hit [Enter] to apply a filter that will only display DNS traffic
- Within PowerShell, use "nslookup" to retrieve the IP addresses of a website(Example: "nslookup google.com" or "ns lookup disney.com")
- Observe traffic
<img src="https://imgur.com/UQ748Ux.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="DNS traffic"/>
  
</p>

<h3>RDP Traffic</h3>

<p>

- Within Wireshark, type in "tcp.port == 3389" in the search bar and hit [Enter] to apply a filter that will only display RDP traffic
- Observe traffic
- Notice that traffic is non-stop because the RDP protocol is constantly showing a live stream from one computer to another, so traffic is always being transmitted

</p>

<h3>Clean Up Azure Environment</h3>

<p>

  - Now that we are finished inpecting traffic between virtual machines, we have to clean up our Azure environment to prevent being charged by Microsoft Azure for allocating resources
  - Close remote desktop connection
  - Delete resource group(s) created at the beginning
  - Verify that the resource group(s) have been deleted

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>

Congratulations on completing this project!  I hope this tutorial has taught you how to create and connect to virtual machines within Azure, and given you better insight on how data flows across a network!
